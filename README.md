# cube
cpp ui program for a Rubix cube, right now is only set up to display the rotating cube but the Rubix cube class itself is fully functional

There are seperate classes for the rubix cube itself, found in cube.h. There is a class for the 3d redering found in things.h, and then there is also the class for the
window creation and event handelling.

Right now the 'run.exe' program is just diplaying the rubix cube in the middle of the window, with the lens moving around in a circular orbit.
